  ## Introduction
This ReadMe, and the associated Jupyter Notebook, were written for assignment in in the Fundamentals Data Analytics module, as part of a Higher Diploma in Science (Data Analytics). The specific questions to be answered are listed in the Questions Asked section below. The overall answers are to be found in the Jupyter notebook (Numpy Assignment.ipynb), along with the associated scripts.

## Technologies and Libraries
### Main Platform
* Python 3.7.2

### External libraries
These are libraries that are not normally part of the standard installation with Python, and will need to be installed prior to running some of these scripts. The questions that the libraries are needed for is listed after the library name.
* Matplotlib.pyplot
* NumPy
* Seaborn

## Setup
In order to run the scripts in this repository, it is necessary to have a complier capable of compiling Python 3.7.2. In addition, it will be necessary to install the external libraries (if you have not done so already), if you want to run the scripts on your own machine.
All the codes used in the Jupyter Notebook have been tested using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), and running through [Cmder](https://cmder.net/).

## Research
Research for the assignment was conducted through extensive internet research. A bibliography is included in Jupyter Notebook, at the end of the document.

## Questions Asked
The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. The specific tasks are:
1. Description of the data set, using descriptive statistics and plots.
2. Regression analysis of the the *total_bill* vs *tip* data set.
3. Additional analysis of the data set, as deemed fit.

## Status
The status of this project is complete. As there is a submission date of the 29th November, 2019, the files will not be altered, from their current format, after that date. Where the last push/alter date is prior to the 29th November, 2019, that date can be viewed as the completion date.
