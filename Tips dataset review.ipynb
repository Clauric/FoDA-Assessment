    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "In this notebook, it is intended to review the tips dataset, which can be found online. To do this, a number of approaches will be taken. The first step will be to review the data using standard descriptive statistics, such as mean, mode, median, quartile ranges, standard deviation, etc. Other information will also be gleaned, such as the skewness, and kurtosis of the data (this will be explained in the relevant section), as well as correlation and covariance between certain data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second step will be to conduct some analysis between the fields of total-bill and tip, to determine a relationship. This analysis will also include both a best fit, and a mean fit lines. These lines can be used for various reasons, and will be discussed in the regression analysis section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third section, two subsets of the data will be extricated from the data, and compared to each other. The two subsets of the data chosen for this analysis are the time that the diner at the location, as well as whether the diner was a smoker or not. Similar analysis will conducted with regards to these two data sets, as was conducted on the overall dataset. A discussion of the results can be found in the discussion of further analysis section.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final section covers other potential analysis that could be undertaken, using the same dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tips dataset that was used in the below was sourced from [here](http://https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/tips.csv). Note the data here is the raw form, to make it easier to import into our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: in this text, a number of ideas, or explanations may be mentioned. These have all been sourced either from the works listed in the bibliography, or from the author’s own ideas. For the sake of legibility, unless a direct quote, comparison, or specific suggestion is used, it will not be cited in the standard academic (Harvard) manner.\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "Before running any analysis of the data, it is necessary to import the data, and the libraries that we will be using. In this case, it is intended to import the following libraries:\n",
    "- **Numpy**: To run some functions for analysis.\n",
    "- **Pandas**: The dataset will be held in various pandas dataframes. The pandas library will also be used to conduct various analytical exercises.\n",
    "- **Seaborn**: Will be used for various plotting functionality.\n",
    "- **Matplotlib.pyplot**: For use in some graphing functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, throughout this notebook, the main dataframe that will hold the dataset will be called *tips_ds*. The below code is used to import the libraries and dataset."

    "- **Skewness**: the direction and amount of asymmetry of the dataset about its mean. If the absolute value of the skewness is:\n",

    "- equal to 0, the data is normally distributed, and symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign of the skewness (i.e. positive or negative) also determines the skewness. Negative skewness indicates that the distribution is skewed to the left, the mean being less than the median, which is less than the mode. Positive values of skewness indicate the opposite, with the distribution being skewed to the right, and the mode being less than the median, which is less than the mean.\n",
    "- **Kurtosis**: the kurtosis of a dataset indicates the sharpness, or flatness, of the peak of the data (around the mode, or mean, depending on the skewness). \n",
    "\n",
    "The kurtosis is measure against the normal distribution, which has a kurtosis of 0. If the kurtosis is negative, then distribution of the data has a smaller standard deviation, as more values are grouped near the mean. This gives the distribution a sharper, and higher peak, and narrower body. A positive kurtosis indicates that there is less grouping around the mean, and indicating that the distribution has a larger standard deviation. This also gives the distribution a flatter, and lower peak, and a wider body.\n",
